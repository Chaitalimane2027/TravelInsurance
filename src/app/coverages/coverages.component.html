                  Travel insurance is a type of insurance that is custom-made for people going on domestic and international travels. It addresses the various risks that one may face during travels, including hospitalization, medical expenses, loss of luggage or documents, cancellation or disruption of flights, and various other costs.
                  Travel insurance covers you from the date of departure till your arrival back at the place of origin. For frequent fliers, a travel plan that remains effective for a certain period is more suitable as it covers multiple travels during the policy period.

                If you plan to embark on multiple trips, you should buy a travel plan in advance to cover all the upcoming trips. Even in the case of a single trip, buying a travel plan in advance is advisable. Typically, it could be on the date of booking the tickets or a few days after that.
                You can also buy travel plans at the last minute. But you may miss out on crucial coverages. For instance, travel insurance offers cancellation coverage. But you will miss out on the same if the cancellation happens before the policy start date. In other words, buy your travel insurance well in advance to avail all benefits.
